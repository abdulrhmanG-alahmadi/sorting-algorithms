# sorting-algorithms
This code contains implementations of five popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. It takes an integer input representing the size of a random array, generates an array of unique integers, and sorts it using each algorithm 10 times, measuring the average execution time in nanoseconds.
