# Sorting Algorithms Comparison
This project contains implementations of five popular sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of these algorithms by sorting randomly generated arrays of unique integers. The user provides the size of the array, and the program calculates the average execution time in nanoseconds for each algorithm after sorting the array 10 times.

# Usage
Run the script.
Enter a number representing the size of the array to generate (must be greater than or equal to 10).
The program will output the average execution time for each sorting algorithm.
